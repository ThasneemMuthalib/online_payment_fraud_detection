# online_payment_fraud_detection

In this report, a descriptive analysis has been done on online payment fraud detection dataset extracted from Kaggle. Payment fraud detection is critical to prevent losses and ensure operations are smooth and secure. Therefore, here my objective is to analyze whether an online transaction is fraud or non-fraud (which is the target variable) with the use of several variables such as step (transaction hour), type, amount etc. on this dataset. Bivariate analysis, time series (creating lag variables, partial autocorrelation plot, pre whitening, identifying the cross correlation), correlation analysis (categorical-continuous: Point bi-serial correlation) is done under this project and the results will be used in the advanced analysis to end up with a statistical model that predicts the fraudulence of an online transaction.
